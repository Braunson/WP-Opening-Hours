Opening Hours is a highly customizable WordPress plugin to set up your venue's opening hours and display them with Shortcodes and Widgets.

== Description ==
* Supports multiple Sets of Opening Hours (e.g. one for your restaurant and one for your bar) that you can use independently.
* Supports Holidays
* Supports Irregular Openings (e.g. different opening hours during Christmas)
* Supports child sets that overwrite your regular opening hours in a specific time period (e.g. seasonal opening hours or an extra day in every second week)
* Four highly customizable Widgets and Shortcodes also displaying contextual information (e.g. "We're currently closed but will be open again on Monday at 8am")

* Is Open Widget: Indicates whether the selected venue is currently open or closed and optionally shows when it will be open again
